Demographics analysis involves examining the characteristics of a population based on factors such as age, gender, location, income, education, and more. It helps businesses and organizations understand their audience, tailor marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and make informed decisions.

#### Demographics Analysis: Overview
Demographics Analysis means understanding the composition of a websiteâ€™s audience based on various demographic factors such as age, gender, location, and interests. Expected results from demographics analysis include detailed insights into who the visitors are, how different demographic groups interact with the site, and which segments are most valuable or underrepresented.

It helps businesses tailor their content, marketing strategies, and user experience to better meet the needs and preferences of their target audience, ultimately driving engagement and conversion rates.

To get started with demographics analysis, we need a dataset containing user demographics. I found an ideal dataset that we can use for this task. Some key columns in the dataset are:

- Town/City: Name of the town or city.
- Country: The country (all entries are from India).
- Users: Total number of users.
- New users: Number of new users.
- Engaged sessions: Total number of engaged sessions.
- Engagement rate: The engagement rate.
- Engaged sessions per user: Average number of engaged sessions per user.
- Average engagement time: Average time users are engaged.
- Event count: Total count of events.
